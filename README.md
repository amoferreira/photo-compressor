# photo-compressor

App that compresses images that are shared to it.

The goal of this simple app is to serve as an example of an app using Work Manager from Android for practice purposes. It follows an instructive app created by Phillip Lackner in the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2JetouoNSc&t=110s
